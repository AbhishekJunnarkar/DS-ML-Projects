As a machine learning developer, I want to have the machine learning process defined and have a sample python code
for each step of the machine learning.

## Machine Learning Process

A typical machine Learning process includes the below 6 building blocks.

### 1. Data Collection

- Accuracy: Ensure the data is accurate, especially for supervised learning, as it serves as the ground truth for training models.
- Relevance: Collect data that is relevant to the problem you are trying to solve. Irrelevant data can negatively impact model performance.
- Quantity: The amount of data needed varies by algorithm. Some require more data to provide meaningful results.
- Variability: Include diverse data to help the model understand different scenarios and improve its predictions.
- Ethics: Address ethical issues such as privacy, security, informed consent, and bias during data collection to avoid harmful biases in predictions.

#### 1.1 How to import data in Python

- Pandas Package: Python's pandas package is powerful and easy to use for data analysis, providing functions for creating, structuring, and importing data.
- Importing Data: You can import data into pandas using the pd.read_csv function for CSV files and pd.read_excel function for Excel files. For multi-sheet Excel files, specify the sheet name if you need a sheet other than the first one.
- Data Structures: Pandas represents data as Series (one-dimensional) and DataFrames (two-dimensional), which can be created from lists, dictionaries, or external files like CSV and Excel.
