The list of design decisions to make sure that as machine learning i am following the best practice and standard approach across all projects

## Data file and jupyter notebooks

- Each project to be named with project-<Num>-<Name-of-project>
- Each project to contain one Jupyter notebook and one data or more data files as required in the same folder.
- Each Jupyter notebook to follow the standard template steps
- If a step doesnt apply it can be left blank.
- If additional steps are required they must be marked as sub-steps
