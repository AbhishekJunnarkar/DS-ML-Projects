# Objective

**Build a model to predict the house prices. The columns are self-explanatory**

## Expected Outcomes
- Programme Directors are interested to see the following:
- How you approach the dataset.
- EDA performed if any
- Different Models built
- Parameters you optimized and your final model
- Final recommendations wrt to the model

## Steps for Modelling

### Data Collection

- Accuracy: Ensure the data is accurate, especially for supervised learning, as it serves as the ground truth for training models.
- Relevance: Collect data that is relevant to the problem you are trying to solve. Irrelevant data can negatively impact model performance.
- Quantity: The amount of data needed varies by algorithm. Some require more data to provide meaningful results.
- Variability: Include diverse data to help the model understand different scenarios and improve its predictions.
- Ethics: Address ethical issues such as privacy, security, informed consent, and bias during data collection to avoid harmful biases in predictions.

### Data Exploration


#### Step 1: Clean the Data

 - Use df.head(), df.info(), and df.describe() to get a feel for:

    - Missing values 
    - Data types 
    - Value ranges

### The data types and non-null counts for your dataset:

| Column               | Type    | Description                                 |
| -------------------- | ------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| `longitude`          | float64 | Geographic coordinate                       |
| `latitude`           | float64 | Geographic coordinate                       |
| `housing_median_age` | int64   | Age of housing units                        |
| `total_rooms`        | int64   | Total number of rooms                       |
| `total_bedrooms`     | float64 | Bedrooms (may have missing in full dataset) |
| `population`         | int64   | Population in the block                     |
| `households`         | int64   | Number of households                        |
| `median_income`      | float64 | Median income in the block                  |
| `median_house_value` | int64   | ðŸŽ¯ Target variable                          |
| `ocean_proximity`    | object  | Categorical variable                        |


#### Step 2: Identify the type of problem

| Problem Type   | Target Output     | Example                           |
|----------------| ----------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Classification | Categories/Labels | Spam detection, Sentiment, Fraud  |
| **Regression** | Continuous Values | Price prediction, Demand forecast |

#### Step 3: One hot encoding: Convert Categorical to binary
