# Setup

## sympy

SymPy stands for Symbolic Python.

It is a Python library for symbolic mathematics.
Think of it like a calculator that works with variables and equations rather than just plugging in numbers.

### Benefits of using Sympy
While SymPy isn’t directly used to train models, it’s great for:

 - Understanding mathematical formulas

 - Deriving gradients symbolically (like in custom ML theory work)

 - Teaching or prototyping math-heavy logic

 - Analyzing equations before implementing numerically

### What can sympy do?

Task | Example
Algebraic simplification | Simplify expressions like x² + 2x + 1
Solving equations | Solve x² - 4 = 0
Calculus | Derivatives, integrals, limits
Symbolic matrix operations | Inverse, determinant, etc.
Series expansion | Taylor/Maclaurin series
Pretty printing (LaTeX) | Beautiful math output
Discrete math | Permutations, combinations
Geometry | Work with circles, lines, angles

## Installing sympy
python3 -m venv myenv
source myenv/bin/activate
pip install sympy

## Install 
brew install numpy

brew install --cask panda
