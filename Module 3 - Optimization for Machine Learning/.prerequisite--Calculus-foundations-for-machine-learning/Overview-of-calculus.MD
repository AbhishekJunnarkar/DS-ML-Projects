# Introduction to Calculus

## Importance of Calculus:
Calculus is essential for understanding the rate of change in different quantities, which is crucial for machine learning.
## Differential Calculus: 
Focuses on finding the rate of change of a function using derivatives, useful for optimization problems.
## Integral Calculus: 
Deals with finding the area under a curve using integrals, which is the reverse process of differentiation.
