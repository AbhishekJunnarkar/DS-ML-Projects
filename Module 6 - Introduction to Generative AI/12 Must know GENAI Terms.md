Here’s a concise definition with examples for each term:

---

### **1. LLM (Large Language Model)**
- **Definition**: LLMs are advanced AI models trained on massive text datasets to understand and generate human-like text. Examples include OpenAI’s GPT-4, Google’s PaLM, and Meta’s LLaMA.

- **Example**:
  ```python
  from transformers import AutoModelForCausalLM, AutoTokenizer
  model = AutoModelForCausalLM.from_pretrained("gpt2")
  tokenizer = AutoTokenizer.from_pretrained("gpt2")
  text = tokenizer.encode("What is LLM?", return_tensors="pt")
  output = model.generate(text, max_length=50)
  print(tokenizer.decode(output[0]))
  ```

---

### **2. Transformers**
- **Definition**: Transformers are a deep learning architecture based on attention mechanisms, used extensively in NLP tasks.

- **Example**: BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers) uses a transformer architecture to process text bidirectionally.

---

### **3. Prompt Engineering**
- **Definition**: The process of crafting specific prompts to guide LLMs in generating desired outputs.

- **Example**:
  ```text
  Prompt: "Translate the following English sentence into French: 'How are you?'"
  Output: "Comment ça va ?"
  ```

---

### **4. Fine-tuning**
- **Definition**: Adjusting a pre-trained LLM on specific data to specialize it for a particular task.

- **Example**: Fine-tuning GPT on legal documents to generate summaries for legal use cases.

---

### **5. Embeddings**
- **Definition**: Numerical representations of text (or tokens) that capture semantic meanings, used for similarity searches or clustering.

- **Example**:
  ```python
  from sentence_transformers import SentenceTransformer
  model = SentenceTransformer('all-MiniLM-L6-v2')
  embedding = model.encode("This is an example sentence.")
  print(embedding)
  ```

---

### **6. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation)**
- **Definition**: A method where the model retrieves relevant information from an external knowledge base and uses it to generate responses.

- **Example**: A chatbot retrieving articles from Wikipedia and summarizing them in its answers.

---

### **7. Tokens**
- **Definition**: Units of text (e.g., words, subwords, or characters) used by LLMs for processing.

- **Example**:
  For the sentence "I love AI," the tokens might be:
  - `"I"`, `"love"`, `"AI"`, or subword units like `"I"`, `"lov"`, `"##e"`, `"AI"`.

---

### **8. Hallucination**
- **Definition**: When an LLM generates text that is factually incorrect or nonsensical.

- **Example**:
  - Input: "Who won the 2022 FIFA World Cup?"
  - Hallucinated Output: "The USA won the 2022 FIFA World Cup." (Incorrect)

---

### **9. Zero-shot**
- **Definition**: The ability of an LLM to perform a task it has never been explicitly trained for.

- **Example**:
  - Prompt: "Translate to German: 'Good morning.'"
  - Output: "Guten Morgen."  
  (Even if the model wasn’t trained specifically for translation tasks.)

---

### **10. Chain-of-Thought**
- **Definition**: A prompting technique that encourages LLMs to generate step-by-step explanations before providing an answer.

- **Example**:
  ```text
  Prompt: "If you have 2 apples and buy 3 more, how many apples do you have? Explain step-by-step."
  Output: "First, you have 2 apples. Then, you buy 3 more. Adding 2 and 3 gives 5 apples."
  ```

---

### **11. Context Window**
- **Definition**: The maximum amount of text (tokens) an LLM can consider at a time during generation.

- **Example**: GPT-4 has a context window of up to 32,000 tokens, allowing it to process larger documents or conversations.

---

### **12. Temperature**
- **Definition**: A parameter controlling the randomness of LLM outputs. Lower values make responses more deterministic, while higher values make them more creative.

- **Example**:
  ```python
  temperature = 0.2  # Deterministic output
  temperature = 1.0  # Creative and varied output
  ```
