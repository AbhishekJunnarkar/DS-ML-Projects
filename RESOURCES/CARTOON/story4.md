### **PAGE 1**  

#### **Panel 1** *(Wide Shot - FBI Headquarters - Night)*  
*A towering high-security government facility. Inside, the FBI‚Äôs **Cyber Defense Command Center** is a hive of flashing monitors and alarms. Suddenly, an emergency alert blares across the room: **"SECURITY BREACH DETECTED!"***  

**ETHAN (narration):**  
*"The Omega Vault‚Äîour most classified intelligence database. Names, locations, and covert operations of every undercover agent worldwide. If this data leaks, those agents are dead."*

### **PAGE 2**  

#### **Panel 1** *(Close-up - Luther Stickell‚Äôs Face, Panicked Expression)*  
*Luther Stickell, the FBI‚Äôs chief data scientist, furiously types on his terminal. Lines of code flicker and disappear as unauthorized commands override security protocols.*  

**Luther Stickell:**  
*"They‚Äôve bypassed our firewalls! They‚Äôre not just stealing files‚Ä¶ they‚Äôre **modifying** mission records!"*  

#### **Panel 2** *(Side Angle - Sarah Monroe Loading Her Pistol)*  
*Agent Sarah Monroe, the FBI‚Äôs top field operative, loads her **SIG P320** with a determined glare.*  

**SARAH:**  
*"If they‚Äôve got someone inside the building, I‚Äôll handle it. You two make sure our intelligence doesn‚Äôt fall into the wrong hands."*  

#### **Panel 3** *(Medium Shot - Ethan‚Äôs Screen, Hacked Code Glitching)*  
*Lines of code shift, **access logs disappear**, and undercover identities are replaced with **false data.***  

**ETHAN (narration):**  
*"This isn‚Äôt just a hack. It‚Äôs **a data takeover.**"*

### **PAGE 3**  

#### **Panel 1** *(Wide Shot - FBI Command Center, Ethan and Zhao Talking)*  
*Ethan leans over Zhao‚Äôs workstation. Zhao‚Äôs screen shows a **data migration in progress‚Äîtables and records are moving, but a red warning blinks: "Stored Procedures & Views Not Migrated."***  

**ETHAN:**  
*"We‚Äôre moving the data, but the intelligence **logic** is staying behind?"*  

**Luther Stickell:**  
*"Stored procedures, surveillance models, encrypted communications‚Äîthey control **how** our system functions. If we don‚Äôt migrate them accurately, the data will be **useless.**"*  

#### **Panel 2** *(Close-up - Ethan‚Äôs Determined Face)*  
*Ethan clenches his fists, thinking fast. Then his eyes widen‚Äîan idea!*  

**ETHAN:**  
*"We need the data masking and GENAI feature of AWS DMS. It can migrate and **reconstruct** our intelligence logic!"*  

#### **Panel 3** *(Close-up - Ethan Slamming a Key on the Console)*  
*The screen lights up. A new interface loads: **"GENAI for AWS DMS ‚Äì LOGIC RECONSTRUCTION ENABLED."***  

**ETHAN:**  
*"AWS DMS with GENAI, Data masking and kerberos authentication, engage protocol Phoenix!"*

### **PAGE 4**  

#### **Panel 1** *(GENAI‚Äôs Interface - Holographic Display Activating)*  
*The AI boots up. Its neural network forms a **web of connections**, reverse-engineering stored procedures and views, masking data and applying encryption to data in transit and at rest.*  

**GENAI (SYSTEM MESSAGE):**  
*"Analyzing dependencies. Reverse-engineering intelligence workflows. Reconstructing mission-critical logic."*  

#### **Panel 2** *(Split Panel - Ethan Watching the Screen, Sarah Taking Down an Intruder Near the Server Room)*  
- **Left side:** Ethan sees the migration progress rise from **50%‚Ä¶ 75%‚Ä¶ 92%...**  
- **Right side:** **Sarah Monroe takes down an armed attacker** attempting to sabotage the server room.  

**SARAH:**  
*"We‚Äôve got company inside the building!"*  

#### **Panel 3** *(Close-up - Ethan Sweating, Watching the Progress Bar at 98%)*  
*Suddenly, a new red alert appears: **"Malware Injection Detected ‚Äì Agent Identities at Risk!"***  

**ETHAN:**  
*"They‚Äôre trying to expose our agents‚Äô real identities before we finish the migration!"*

### **PAGE 5**  

#### **Panel 1** *(GENAI‚Äôs Interface - Emergency Override Sequence Running)*  
*GENAI adapts, counteracting the cyberattack. The progress bar hits **100%** with a green flash.*  

**GENAI (SYSTEM MESSAGE):**  
*"Migration Complete. Counter-Intrusion Protocols Engaged."*  

#### **Panel 2** *(Wide Shot - FBI Command Center, Ethan and Zhao Celebrating)*  
*Zhao slumps back in his chair, exhausted but relieved. Ethan wipes his forehead, staring at the monitor.*  

**Luther Stickell:**  
*"That‚Ä¶ that actually worked. But what about **data masking**? If agent profiles were exposed‚Äî"*  

#### **Panel 3** *(GENAI Running Final Encryption Protocols)*  
*The system blinks as GENAI initiates **data masking and encryption.** All undercover agent identities are anonymized in real-time.*  

**GENAI (SYSTEM MESSAGE):**  
*"Data masking engaged. Undercover identities encrypted. Anomaly detection activated."*  

#### **Panel 4** *(Monitor Showing Final System Message - ‚ÄúOmega Vault Secure.‚Äù)*  
*The red alerts disappear. The final message blinks in green.*  

**SYSTEM MESSAGE:**  
*"Mission Accomplished. FBI Intelligence Secure."*  

#### **Panel 5** *(Sarah Monroe Re-entering, Smirking at Ethan)*  
*Sarah, covered in dust from her scuffle outside, leans against the door.*  

**SARAH:**  
*"So, we won?"*  

#### **Panel 6** *(Close-up - Ethan Grinning at Sarah)*  
*Ethan leans back, crossing his arms.*  

**ETHAN:**  
*"Yeah. But next time, I‚Äôm letting the AI do the heavy lifting first."*

### **Key Enhancements in This Version:**
‚úÖ **Main Issue: Migrating Stored Procedures & Views with Accuracy** ‚Äì The plot now focuses heavily on the **complexity of intelligence migration**, emphasizing the importance of reconstructing stored procedures for **operational continuity.**  

‚úÖ **Data Masking & Encryption Added** ‚Äì GENAI not only migrates data but ensures **agent identities are protected** from exposure.  

‚úÖ **Cyber & Physical Threats Combined** ‚Äì Balances **cybersecurity tension** with Sarah‚Äôs **physical fight** against infiltrators.  

‚úÖ **More Intensity & Realism** ‚Äì The story now **feels like a real intelligence operation**, with life-and-death stakes for undercover agents worldwide.
