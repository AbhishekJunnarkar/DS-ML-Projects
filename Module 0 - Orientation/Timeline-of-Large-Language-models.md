### **Timeline of Large Language Models (LLMs)**  

#### **Pre-Deep Learning Era (1950s - 2000s)**  
- **1950** – Alan Turing proposes the **Turing Test** in *"Computing Machinery and Intelligence."*  
- **1957** – Noam Chomsky introduces **Generative Grammar**, shaping computational linguistics.  
- **1966** – **ELIZA**, one of the first chatbots, is developed by Joseph Weizenbaum.  
- **1970s-1980s** – Rule-based **Expert Systems** and NLP models like SHRDLU emerge.  
- **1997** – IBM’s **Deep Blue** defeats Garry Kasparov, showing early AI capabilities.  

#### **Early Machine Learning NLP Models (2000s - 2015)**  
- **2001** – IBM develops **Watson**, an AI-powered question-answering system.  
- **2013** – Google releases **Word2Vec**, enabling better word embeddings.  
- **2014** – **Seq2Seq** models and **Attention Mechanism** (by Bahdanau et al.) revolutionize NLP.  

#### **Rise of Transformer Models (2017 - 2019)**  
- **2017** – Google introduces the **Transformer architecture** (*"Attention is All You Need"*).  
- **2018** – Google releases **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)** for contextual understanding.  
- **2019** – OpenAI unveils **GPT-2**, showing advanced text generation capabilities.  

#### **Scaling Up: Large Language Models (2020 - Present)**  
- **2020** – OpenAI launches **GPT-3** (175B parameters), showcasing few-shot learning.  
- **2021** – Google unveils **LaMDA**, focusing on conversational AI, and DeepMind introduces **Gopher**.  
- **2022** – OpenAI releases **ChatGPT** (based on GPT-3.5), which gains massive adoption.  
- **2023** – OpenAI launches **GPT-4**, significantly improving multimodal capabilities.  
- **2023** – **DeepSeek** releases **DeepSeek-V2**, a Chinese-focused large language model.  
- **2024** – **DeepSeek Coder**, an advanced AI model for code generation, is launched.  
- **2024** – Google introduces **Gemini 1.5**, and OpenAI unveils **Sora**, a video generation model.  

### **Future (2025 and Beyond)**
