## Chapter 1: Vectors
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fNk_zzaMoSs&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=1
"The introduction of numbers as coordinates is an act of violence" - Hermann Weyl

- Vector coordinates
- Vector Addition
- Vector Multiplication by a scalar
In this chapter, we learn the basics of vectors, which are fundamental to linear algebra. 
Topics include understanding vector coordinates, vector addition, and how vectors can be scaled through scalar multiplication. 
- Hermann Weyl’s quote emphasizes the abstraction and importance of coordinates in mathematics.

"Mathematics requires a small doze, not of genius, but of an imaginative freedom which, in 
a larger dose, would be insanity"

This chapter explores linear combinations—how vectors can be combined to form new vectors.
It introduces the concept of span (the set of all possible linear combinations) and basis vectors—the fundamental 
building blocks that span a vector space.

## Chapter 3: Linear Transformations and Matrices
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kYB8IZa5AuE&list=PLZHQObOWTQDPD3MizzM2xVFitgF8hE_ab&index=4

Here, we explore how linear transformations map vectors to other vectors. 
The chapter also introduces the relationship between transformations and matrices, providing the foundation for 
understanding how matrices represent linear mappings.
## Chapter 4: Matrix multiplication as composition

This chapter explains how matrix multiplication works as the composition of linear transformations. 
Understanding this concept helps connect matrix operations with real-world problems in computer graphics, physics, and engineering.
## Chapter 5: Three Dimensional Linear Transformations

We dive into three-dimensional transformations in this chapter, focusing on how transformations work in 3D space,
like rotations and reflections, which are represented by 3x3 matrices.
## Chapter 6: The Determinant

The determinant is a scalar value that can be computed from a matrix. 
This chapter discusses its properties and how it can be used to determine things like invertibility and the volume scaling factor of a transformation.
## Chapter 7: Inverse Matrices, column space and null space
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uQhTuRlWMxw&t=5s

This chapter explores the concept of the inverse of a matrix, along with column space (the span of the matrix’s columns) 
and null space (the set of vectors that get mapped to the zero vector by the matrix).
## Chapter 8: Non Square Matrices as Transformations between dimensions
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=v8VSDg_WQlA

Here, we examine non-square matrices and how they represent transformations between different dimensions 
(e.g., mapping 3D space to 2D space). These matrices don't have inverses but still play key roles in linear mappings.
## Chapter 9: Dot Products and duality
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LyGKycYT2v0

This chapter delves into the dot product and introduces the concept of duality, which helps us understand how different 
vector spaces relate to each other, particularly in higher dimensions.
## Chapter 10: Cross Products
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eu6i7WJeinw

We explore the cross product of vectors in three-dimensional space, a tool for computing perpendicular vectors. 
This operation is used widely in 3D geometry and physics, such as finding forces acting on an object.
## Chapter 11: Cross Products in light of linear transformations
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BaM7OCEm3G0

Building on the previous chapter, this video examines the cross product through the lens of linear transformations. 
We look at how the cross product can be viewed as a special case of a transformation in 3D space.
## Chapter 12: Cramer's rule

Cramer's Rule provides a method to solve systems of linear equations using determinants. 
This chapter breaks down the process of using this rule to find solutions for a system of equations represented by a matrix.
## Chapter 13: Change of Basis
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P2LTAUO1TdA

This chapter introduces the idea of changing the basis of a vector space, explaining how to represent vectors in different
coordinate systems or bases. This is essential for simplifying problems and understanding vector space transformations.
## Chapter 14: Eigenvectors and Eigenvalues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PFDu9oVAE-g

One of the most important concepts in linear algebra, eigenvectors and eigenvalues are introduced here. 
These are used to solve problems in many fields, including physics, computer graphics, and machine learning.
## Chapter 15: A quick trick for computing eigenvalues
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e50Bj7jn9IQ

This chapter presents a trick to compute eigenvalues more efficiently without solving the full characteristic equation, 
making the process faster in certain scenarios.
## Chapter 16: Abstract vector spaces
https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=e50Bj7jn9IQ

The final chapter introduces abstract vector spaces, which generalize the concepts of vectors and vector operations beyond 
the familiar finite-dimensional spaces. This sets the foundation for more advanced topics in linear algebra and functional analysis.
