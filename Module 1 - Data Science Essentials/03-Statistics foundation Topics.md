# Statistics foundation 2: Probability
- The importance of probabilities
- Probability Definition: Probability is the percent chance of something happening, calculated by dividing the desired outcome by the total number of possible outcomes.

### Types of Probability:
- Classical Probability: Based on known possible outcomes (e.g., flipping a coin).
- Empirical Probability: Based on experimental or historical data (e.g., a basketball player's free throw success rate).
- Subjective Probability: Based on personal belief or experience (e.g., a CEO's confidence in launching a new product).

Application: Understanding probability helps in making informed decisions and predictions in various scenarios.

### Types of Probability:

- Even Odds: Scenarios like coin flips, rolling dice, picking cards, and raffles where each outcome has an equal chance.
- Weighted Odds: Real-world scenarios like weather, science, medicine, sports, and business where outcomes have different probabilities.
- Sum of Probabilities: The total probability of all possible outcomes always equals 100%.
- Sample Space: The set of all possible outcomes in a probability scenario.

### Permutations

- Definition: Permutations consider the order of items. For example, AB and BA are different permutations.
- Formula: The number of permutations of n objects is calculated using n! (n factorial). 

For example, 5! = 5 x 4 x 3 x 2 x 1 = 120.

- Partial Permutations: When selecting x items from n objects, use the formula n! / (n - x)!. 

For example, selecting the top 3 finishers out of 8 runners is calculated as 8! / 5! = 336.

### Combinations

- Definition: Combinations are used when the order of selection does not matter. For example, selecting a team from a group of students.
- Formula: The formula for combinations is N! / (N - X)! X!, where N is the total number of objects and X is the number of objects chosen at one time.

### Percentiles

- Definition: Percentiles indicate the relative standing of a value within a dataset. For example, being in the 98th percentile means you scored better than 98% of the participants.
- Calculation: Percentile rank can be calculated using the formula: (Number of values below the score / Total number of values) * 100.
- Application: Percentiles are commonly used in standardized testing and income distribution to understand how a particular value compares to the rest of the dataset.
