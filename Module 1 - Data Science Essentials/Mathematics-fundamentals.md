# Basics of Mathematics

## 1. Algebraic Equations

Algebraic Equations are mathematical statements that use variables, constants, and mathematical operations like addition, 
subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponents. They represent relationships between quantities and are set equal 
to each other using an equal sign (=).

### Structure of an Algebraic Equation

```markdown
An algebraic equation typically looks like this:

\[
ax^n + bx^{n-1} + ..... + c = 0
\]

- **Variables**: Letters like \(x, y, z\) that represent unknown values.
- **Constants**: Numbers like \(2, -5, \frac{3}{4}\) that do not change.
- **Operations**: \(+, -, \times, \div\).
- **Degree**: The highest power of the variable in the equation.

## Types of Algebraic Equations

### 1. Linear Equations (Degree = 1)
- **Example**: \(2x + 3 = 7\)  
  (Straight-line graph)

### 2. Quadratic Equations (Degree = 2)
- **Example**: \(x^2 + 5x + 6 = 0\)  
  (Parabolic graph)

### 3. Cubic Equations (Degree = 3)
- **Example**: \(x^3 - 3x^2 + 2x = 0\)  
  (S-curve graph)

### 4. Polynomial Equations
- **Example**: \(4x^4 - x^3 + 3x - 2 = 0\)

### 5. Rational Equations
- **Example**: \(\frac{1}{x} + \frac{2}{x+1} = 3\)

### 6. Exponential or Logarithmic Equations
- **Example**: \(2^x = 8\) or \(\log(x) + 2 = 3\)  
  *(These aren't strictly algebraic but involve similar problem-solving techniques.)*

## Solving Algebraic Equations

To solve algebraic equations, we find the value(s) of the variable(s) that satisfy the equation.

### Example 1 (Linear):
Solve \(2x + 3 = 7\):
\[
2x = 4 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2
\]

### Example 2 (Quadratic):
Solve \(x^2 - 5x + 6 = 0\):
\[
(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0 \quad \Rightarrow \quad x = 2 \text{ or } x = 3
\]

Algebraic equations are the foundation of mathematics and are widely used in physics, engineering, finance, and many other fields!
